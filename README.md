## (1) Overview 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## (2) Results                                                                     

### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
IS_SUCCESSFUL column

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
Columns:
PPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT 

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Columns:
EIN, NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
